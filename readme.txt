There is growing interest in interacting with devices inside the body in the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research community, as well as in the Body Modification Community. Implanted devices are anticipated to provide opportunities for sensory augmentation, biometric data collection, data-storage or novel HCI applications. This growing interest can be observed looking at workshops at leading HCI conferences, various self-experimentation projects, such as the Circadia by Grindhouse Wetware, or review papers on this very topic.

Implanted devices are not new - pacemakers and dental implants date back to the late 1950’s and have since become established in medical practice. Common medical implants include joint replacements, drug delivery systems, cerebral shunts, stents, cardiac monitors and pacemakers, and even brain implants that provide deep brain stimulation to Parkinson patients or treat seizures for epilepsy patients. Implants are also common for plastic surgery purposes, most notably the breast implant, which dates back to the 1960’s.

In parallel to these more established practices, the body modification community has developed methods, practices and technologies of their own, including the development of subdermal implants. These are usually injection molded silicone objects which are implanted under the skin for aesthetic purposes. The manufacturing process of these subdermal implants allows encapsulating objects inside the implant. This enables implantation of unconventional objects, such as the ashes of a loved one or electronic circuitry. There is a trend amongst self-identified ‘grinders’ or ‘wet-ware hackers’ to appropriate these methods for the design of implantable electronic devices.
